          This project was completed under the supervision of NLP experts at Northeastern University.
          The goal was to compare the performance of three different models on a Kaggle dataset that
          provided text data and emotional labels.
        </P>
        <P>
          The models used in the experiment were Logistic Regression, LSTM, and a 
          DistilBERT transformer model. I prepared the data and created training, testing, 
          and validation dataset. The three models performed well, resulting in accuracies of 87%, 92%, and 93% respectively, with
          the DistilBERT model showing the most promise (likely due to its self-attention mechanism).
        </P>
