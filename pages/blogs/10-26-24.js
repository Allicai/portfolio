          A lot of my life has been spent pronouncing my name for people. The
          various pronunciations I&apos;ve come across are something I can use
          to split my life up into periods based on what I preferred to go by,
          and distinguishes different groups of people I&apos;ve met and how
          close I was with them.

          Vinit
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          To begin, let&apos;s cover what my name really is. Vinit. It&apos;s a name
          I hated for varying periods of my life, but I&apos;ve learned to
          appreciate it as the name my parents gave me, and its meaning.
          According to experts in the field (I asked my parents when I was home
          for the holidays), Vinit means &quot;knowledge&quot; or
          &quot;wisdom&quot; in Sanskrit, and is typically a name for people who
          are studious and love to learn. I think this fits me well. I&apos;ve
          always been a curious person, and I love learning new things. From
          sports to technology to the arts, I love picking up skills and trying
          my hand at them. Sometimes they aren&apos;t for me, but I&apos;ve
          gained quite a lot of hobbies and interests, including drawing, video
          editing, animation, architecture, tennis, soccer, as well as skills
          that I pursue in my career, such as data science, machine learning,
          and programming/problem solving at large. Vinit (when properly
          pronounced) is a name that I associate with my family, and people who
          knew me before I came to America. It&apos;s a name that is comforting
          to me, and one that I am proud to have.

          Vin-eet
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          This is the earliest incorrect pronunciation of my name that I can
          remember. It&apos;s a pronunciation that I&apos;ve heard from my
          teachers and classmates in America, and it&apos;s a pronunciation I
          highly dislike. I was never that close with the people who knew me as
          &quot;Vin-eet&quot;, and while them pronouncing my name wrong
          wasn&apos;t the reason, it serves as a convenient reminder of how
          little they know about me. This pronunciation has followed me
          throughout my life; I met friends through tennis, soccer, and other
          activities who would also call me &quot;Vin-eet&quot;, but only those
          who I knew closely would call me Vinit or had some nickname for me.
          It&apos;s one of the many pronunciations of my name that I&apos;ve
          heard, but is by far the one that I associate with people who
          don&apos;t know me well.

          Vinnie
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          Vinnie is a nickname that I love quite a bit. It was given to me by a
          childhood coach I had when I played soccer, who joked to my parents
          that I played like Baggio (this is a lie, I was total rubbish), so I
          should be called Vincenzo. My parents didn&apos;t like the idea, but they
          found middle ground with Vinnie. An Italian coach I had for tennis
          during my teenage years also came to the same conclusion, joking that
          I had an Italian temperment to my parents when I&apos;d get
          competitive at the club. It&apos;s a name that I associate with my old
          teammates and friends from high school who I know to this day.
          They&apos;re some of the closest people to me, and seeing them when I
          go back home has been a constant during an otherwise fast changing
          part of my life.

          Vince
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          Australia has always been a part of my life. I have family in Sydney,
          and I love the country and its people. Friends from my time there call
          me Vince, although the reasoning was simply for convenience; they knew
          me as Vin, but there were already 2 other Vin&apos;s in the group.
          It&apos;s a name that I associate with a rather exclusive group of
          friends, but is among the nicknames I am most fond of, and one that no
          one outside that group calls me. That said, it has led many people to
          assume my name is Vincent when hearing it for the first time.

          Vin
        </Heading>
        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          And now, to the present. Vin. It&apos;s a name that I began to offer
          to people in college when they first meet me. It&apos;s the easy
          alternative that most seem to prefer, and it&apos;s a name that
          I&apos;ve come to like quite a bit. While some friends from earlier in
          my life came to this same nickname (since it is an obvious one), I
          often vetoed it for those I was not that close with. It&apos;s a name
          I associate to my time in college, a period I distinguish from my time
          in high school, and also what I tend to go by with people I meet in my
          career. It&apos;s been useful in being more approachable to those
          I&apos;ve met through my internships thus far and I&apos;ll likely
          stick with it for the rest of my life; it&apos;s a name that is still
          unique, gets rid of the obstacle that pronunciation makes for Indians
          in America, and is something I think fits me well as I&apos;ve
          gotten used to it over the years.
