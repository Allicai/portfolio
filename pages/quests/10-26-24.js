        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          Over the years, I&apos;ve come to realize that creating isn’t just
          something I do for school or others—it&apos;s something I do for
          myself. From crafting wooden cars in woodworking class to designing
          shelves with my dad&apos;s tools, I’ve always been fueled by the joy
          of making. It wasn&apos;t just the finished product that mattered; it
          was the thrill of bringing an idea to life and sharing it with others.
          That feeling has stayed with me, shaping who I am today.

        <Text fontSize="md" mb={4}>
          I&apos;ve explored so many creative outlets: drawing, 3D modeling,
          designing clothes, making music, video editing, coding, and even game
          development. Each new venture taught me something valuable. People
          often tell me I&apos;m talented, but what they don&apos;t see is the
          time and effort behind the skills I&apos;ve built. The truth is, most
          people with great ideas never pick up the tools or skills they need to
          make their visions real—and that frustrates me. Imagination alone
          isn&apos;t enough. The line between{' '}

          is just effort and persistence.

            tragedy

          ever attempting it. Nobody masters a skill overnight. You won&apos;t
          know if you&apos;re naturally gifted or if it&apos;s something
          you&apos;ll fall in love with until you give it a chance.

          I&apos;m no master, but I&apos;ve failed more times than I can

          we live in a time where resources are at our fingertips. The
          difference between people who create and those who don&apos;t
          isn&apos;t talent—it&apos;s the time and effort they&apos;re willing
          to invest.

          Everyone has the capacity to create, but ideas too often stay trapped
          in the imagination. Don&apos;t let fear of failure or lack of
          immediate skill hold you back. From someone who&apos;s failed more
          times than most, I urge you to{' '}
